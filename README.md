# Homelab Repository

This repository serves as a central hub for **DevOps and Cybersecurity experimentation**.
It organizes projects in my homelab into clear categories based on the skills I’m exploring including containerized services, Cybersecurity, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), monitoring, and cloud/DevSecOps practices.

# Repository Structure
- **docker/** → Containerized labs
  - NAS (Nextcloud, Samba)
  - Media server (Jellyfin + Transmission/Deluge)
  - Gluetun VPN gateway
  - DNS + Ad blocker (Technitium DNS, Pi-hole)
- **infosec-labs/** → Labs covering different areas of cybersecurity
  - Kali penetration testing
  - Firewall (pfSense/OPNsense)
  - SIEM (Security Onion + Elastic Stack)
  - Vulnerability scanning (OpenVAS)
  - Container security (Trivy, Docker Bench)
  - Windows Server 2019 AD simulation
- **IaC** → DevOps + IaC labs
  - Terraform provisioning
  - Ansible automation
  - Kubernetes labs
- **monitoring/** → Observability stack
  - Prometheus + Grafana
  - Centralized logging (Loki/ELK)

## Tech Stack
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, Ansible 
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes (K3s) 
- **Networking & Security:** Gluetun VPN, Technitium DNS, pfSense, OpenVAS, Security Onion 
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, ELK/Wazuh 
- **Security Tools:** Kali Linux, Trivy, Docker Bench, Windows Server 2019 AD 
- **Learning Platforms:** TryHackMe (Beginner + Blue Team paths)

## Purpose
- Build reproducible homelab setups
- Experiment with cloud and DevOps tooling
- Dive deeper into security concepts (firewalls, SIEM, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing)
- Document everything for clarity and teachability
